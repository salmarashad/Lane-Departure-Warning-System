# Lane-Departure-Warning-System

## Project Overview
This project implements a self-driving car safety system designed to enhance road safety and prevent accidents. The system ensures the vehicle stays within its designated lane, avoids obstacles, and adapts to low-light conditions by activating its headlights automatically. By addressing these critical challenges, this project contributes to improving road safety for drivers, passengers, and other road users.

## Key Features
### 1. Lane Adherence:
The car uses an IR sensor to detect and stay within its designated lane. If the vehicle veers outside the lane, an alert is emitted to notify the system of the departure.

### 2. Obstacle Avoidance:
The car employs an obstacle detection sensor (ultrasonic) to identify potential collisions. If an obstacle is detected, the car rotates to avoid the collision and adjusts its path to align with the new lane.

### 3. Low-Light Adaptation:
The system uses light sensors to detect low-light conditions. When such conditions are detected, the car's headlights automatically turn on, improving visibility and safety.
